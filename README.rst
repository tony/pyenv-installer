pyenv installer
===============

This tool installs ``pyenv`` and friends. It is inspired by `rbenv-installer <https://github.com/fesplugas/rbenv-installer>`__.

Installation / Update / Uninstallation
--------------------------------------

There are two ways to install `pyenv <https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv>`__.
The PyPi support is not tested by many users yet, so the
direct way is still recommended if you want to play it safe.

Github way (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install::

    $ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer/master/bin/pyenv-installer | sh

Update::

    $ pyenv update

Uninstall: ``pyenv`` is installed within ``$PYENV_ROOT``
(default: ``~/.pyenv``). To uninstall, just remove it::

    $ rm -fr ~/.pyenv

PyPi way
~~~~~~~~

**WARNING** still a very hacky proof of concept. Does not work with Python 3 at all yet and in Python 2 only with 
the use of the --egg parameter.

Install::

    $ pip install --egg pyenv


In the current implementation updates and uninstallation works exactly like
the github way.

**NOTE**: ``pip freeze`` will not show pyenv as installed as this tool is just a
thin wrapper around the shell install script.

Development and testing
-----------------------

The `project on github <https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer>`__ contains
a setup for vagrant to test the installer inside a vagrant managed virtual image.

If you don't know vagrant yet: just `install the latest
package <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>`__, open a shell in
this project directory and say

::

    $ vagrant up
    $ vagrant ssh

Now you are inside the vagrant container and your prompt should like
something like ``vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$``

The project (this repository) is mapped into the vagrant image at
/vagrant

::

    $ cd /vagrant
    $ python setup.py install
    $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    $ echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    $ echo 'eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    $ source ~/.bashrc

Pyenv should be installed and responding now.
